### Secret Message
Using array methods, you will transform an array of strings into a secret message!
You should consult the *Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)* 
for reference on any method with which you are not familiar.


### The .map() Method
The second iterator we’re going to cover is .map(). When .map() is called on an array, it takes an argument of a callback function and returns a new array! Take a look at an example of calling .map():

>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
 
>const bigNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * 10;
>});
>.map() works in a similar manner to .forEach()— the major difference is that .map() returns a new array.
